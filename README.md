# hyperspectral-image-classification
This code is designed for performing classification of hyperspectral image data and visualizing the results. Hyperspectral images are multi-dimensional data sets. The code focuses on the classification of hyperspectral data into different categories or classes, and it provides visualizations to help assess the quality of the classification results.


This classification also works on many data sets such as Houston 2013, Houston 2018, University of Pavia (UP) and Pavia Center (PC) and Indian Pines.
